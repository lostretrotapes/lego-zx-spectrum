# Lego ZX Spectrum

Work in progress of a ZX Spectrum in Lego form. Guide and photos of the build can be found at my website at https://www.lostretrotapes.com/lego-zx-spectrum/

To get the build you will need Bricklink Studio from https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page and the `ZX Spectrum_build.io` file from this repo

Next steps are:

1. Place mount for Pico inside the case
2. Run a HDMI connector to the back
3. Run Power into the case
4. Improve the instructions
5. Put a download for printable box
